# Mstat-Project

## This is the project for my master degree in statistics. 

I will use **machine learning** models for **regression and classification**. First, I do prediction on DECISION variable using all other variables including RATING. However, later I will predict RATING using other variables. I will not use DECISION to predict RATING.
